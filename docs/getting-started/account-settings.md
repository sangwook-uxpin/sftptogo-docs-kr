To manage your personal account profile and security settings, click your avatar (at the top-right corner of the screen) and then click **Account settings**.

## Profile

You can change your name here. To change your avatar, create one using Gravatar.

## Security

Click **Change password** to change your password. You will be requested to enter your current password as well. Your new password needs to be at least 10 characters including a number, a lowercase and an uppercase letter.

If you are logged in but don't remember your current password, you can initiate the "forgot password" protocol by clicking **Reset your password by email**. After clicking it, find the **Reset your SFTP To Go password** email in your inbox and follow the instructions there in order to reset your password.

### Multi-factor authentication

Multi-factor authentication (or MFA for short) is used to verify that the identity of a user is genuine. It requires a user to present two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) for authentication. In SFTP To Go, in addition to your email and password authentication, you can secure your account using an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password and many others).

To enable mult-factor authentication, click **Setup Multi-factor Authentcation** and folow the on-screen instructions.

You may always disable MFA by clicking **Disable Multi-factor Authentication**.

:::note
Administrators in your organizations can monitor whether you have enabled or disabled MFA.
