Use The credentials tab to:

1. Access your SFTP server information (host, usernames, and passwords). 
2. Add or remove credentials.
3. Manage access options for credentials (home directories, permissions, public keys, inbound network rules, and rotate passwords).

:::tip
We recommend rotating passwords every 90 days. The credentials list shows the password age for each credential.

When you first sign in to your dashboard, a single default **root** credential appears, allowing you to connect and manage files in your storage. This user can't be deleted and its permissions can't be changed. You can add public SSH keys to it in order to use public key authentication, as well as rotate its password.
