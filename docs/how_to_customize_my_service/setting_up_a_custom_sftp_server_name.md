To personalize your storage, you can replace SFTP To Go's hostname with a subdomain of a domain you own. To do so, copy your add-on host name from the dashboard and add a CNAME record to point to the host name. For example:

| Record | Name | Target                               |
|--------|------|--------------------------------------|
| CNAME  | sftp | yellow-rectangle-14793.sftptogo.com. |
