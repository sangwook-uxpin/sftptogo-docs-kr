To connect to your SFTP To Go storage using the FTPS protocol, follow these general instructions:

1. Go to your organization's credentials list (click **Credentials** in the menu).
2. In the credentials list, expand the credentials you'd like to use.
3. Copy the host, username, and the password to your SFTP client of choice. Make sure you use the default FTPS port (21) in your connection.

Follow this [link](https://sftptogo.com/blog/guides/) for more examples. You can also find useful code snippets in the dashboard by clicking the credentials' menu button (...) and then click `<> Code Snippets`.
